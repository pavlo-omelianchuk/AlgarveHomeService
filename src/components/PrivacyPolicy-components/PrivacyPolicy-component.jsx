      <h1 className="privacy-header">4. Recipients of your personal data</h1>
      <p className="privacy-message">
        In order to operate Algarve Mobile Services, we use a number of digital tools operated by
        third-party companies. In this context, some personal data is sent to them.
        <br />
        In general, your data may be sent to third-party companies, but this transmission will be in
        line with the framework for the use of digital tools provided by third-party service
        providers.
        <br />
        In that respect, Algarve Mobile Services has implemented organisational and contractual
        measures, and has undertaken the necessary verifications to ensure that the third parties
        who have access to your personal data comply with the applicable regulations with regard to
        the protection of personal data.
        <br />
        When a Customer is making a Booking, Algarve Mobile Services sends some personal data to the
        Partner so that they can carry out the At-home Service at the Customer's home. It includes,
        for example, the Customer's name, surname, photo or home address. This is necessary for the
        smooth operation of Algarve Mobile Services.
      </p>
      <h1 className="privacy-header">5. Data retention period for your personal data</h1>
      <p className="privacy-message">
        The Users' data is processed throughout the duration of their relationship with Algarve
        Mobile Services.
        <br />
        Thereby if you are a Customer, we process your personal data if your Account is active or
        when you make a Booking. If you are a Partner, we also process your data if your Account is
        active or if you provide At-home Services through the Platform.
        <br />
        Our relationship can be terminated by various situations, including: (i) you explicitly
        state your wish to terminate the T&C agreement and to give up the use of Algarve Mobile
        Services, (ii) you ask for your Account, and all personal data associated with it, to be
        deleted or (iii) your Account is inactive during a specific period, set at 5 years for
        Customers and 5 years for Partners.
        <br />
        From the moment our relationship ends, we implement a retention policy for your personal
        data.
        <br />
        For data concerning Prospects, our policy is as follows: we retain the data for a period of
        three years, starting from the collection of this data or the last contact made by the
        Prospect (for example, a request for documentation or clicking on a hypertext link contained
        in an email).

      <h1 className="privacy-header">6. Security of your Data</h1>
      <p className="privacy-message">
        Algarvr Mobile Services has implemented all the appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to
        guarantee the rights and freedoms of Users, particularly by protecting personal data against
        unauthorised access, destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of personal data
        transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
        <br />
        All software and digital tools which we use are password-protected and there is limited
        access to certain data (for example, only some people at Algarvr Mobile Services have access to the
        transaction data supplied by Customers and sent to our payment services provider).
      </p>
      <h1 className="privacy-header">7. Amendment of the personal data policy</h1>
      <p className="privacy-message">
        We may regularly amend this personal data policy because the way in which we process
        personal data may change due to the evolution of our technology solution, our services or
        applicable rules. If this is the case, you will be informed of any updates, either by email
        or by way of a statement on our website, at least 8 days before a significant amendment of

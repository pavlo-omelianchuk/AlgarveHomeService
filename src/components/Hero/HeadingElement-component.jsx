        Therapeutic Massage vs Deep Tissue. Therapeutic massage is a general term that describes any
        type of massage modality that helps relieve pain, reduce stress, and work on a specific
        problem—such as a frozen shoulder. People tend to assume therapeutic massage means deep
        tissue massage, and that they will get a very strong massage. But this is not always the
        case. Deep tissue massage is great at breaking down scar tissue and getting your blood
        circulating, but it may not be what you need on a particular day. A good therapist will
        apply the specific techniques and the right amount of pressure to address your need, and
        sometimes that’s a lighter touch. Types of Therapeutic Massage There are several different
        types of therapeutic massage in addition to deep tissue massage, such as: neuromuscular
        massage myofascial massage trigger point therapy sports massage Many therapists will use a
        combination of techniques depending on what your body needs. In addition, therapists will
        often take additional classes in different techniques. You can see our therapists
        specialties by clicking their bios. Benefits of Deep Tissue Massage Most of our clients are
        interested in deep tissue massage, and that makes sense because it is a great way to manage
        pain. Deep tissue massage—as well as the other therapeutic massage methods—can give you a
        lot of relief from chronic pain. Many of our clients come in for frozen shoulder treatment
        and neck pain—two side effects of working on computers all day. Deep Tissue Side Effects
        Many people want to know what the side effects of deep tissue massage are. That’s a great
        question, and it varies from person to person—and it can even vary for you depending on
        what’s going on in your body the day you get a massage. Typically, people may feel more
        muscle soreness for a day or two after the massage, especially if the therapist gives you a
        strong massage. A deep tissue massage shouldn’t cause horrible pain—and if it does you need
        to tell your therapist you need less pressure. However, if they’ve been working your
        muscles, you will probably feel it as the toxins leave your body. Another side effect is a
        feeling of disorientation when the massage is over (we call it massage drunk). You may be a
        little light headed and out of it. That’s very normal. Just sit in the lobby and drink some
        water until the feeling passes! You’ll usually be fine in 10 to 15 minutes. Finally, a deep
        tissue massage will leave you dehydrated. That’s why your therapist gives you water when
        it’s over. It is very important to drink plenty of water after a therapeutic massage. Where

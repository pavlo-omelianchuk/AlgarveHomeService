      We provide Professional massage at Home over all the Algarve. Every time you are on holidays
      in warm Algarve, Portugal. We will be happy to visit you with best Massage Therapists for
      Beauticians. But for now, you can read about Therapeutic Massage vs Deep Tissue. Therapeutic
      massage is a general term that describes any type of massage modality that helps relieve pain,
      reduce stress, and work on a specific problem—such as a frozen shoulder. People tend to assume
      therapeutic massage means deep tissue massage, and that they will get a very strong massage.
      But this is not always the case. Deep tissue massage is great at breaking down scar tissue and
      getting your blood circulating, but it may not be what you need on a particular day. A good
      therapist will apply the specific techniques and the right amount of pressure to address your
      need, and sometimes that’s a lighter touch. Types of Therapeutic Massage There are several
      different types of therapeutic massage in addition to deep tissue massage, such as:
      neuromuscular massage myofascial massage trigger point therapy sports massage Many therapists
      will use a combination of techniques depending on what your body needs. In addition,
      therapists will often take additional classes in different techniques. You can see our
      therapists specialties by clicking their bios. Benefits of Deep Tissue Massage Most of our
      clients are interested in deep tissue massage, and that makes sense because it is a great way
      to manage pain. Deep tissue massage—as well as the other therapeutic massage methods—can give
      you a lot of relief from chronic pain. Many of our clients come in for frozen shoulder
      treatment and neck pain—two side effects of working on computers all day. Deep Tissue Side
      Effects Many people want to know what the side effects of deep tissue massage are. That’s a
      great question, and it varies from person to person—and it can even vary for you depending on
      what’s going on in your body the day you get a massage. Typically, people may feel more muscle
      soreness for a day or two after the massage, especially if the therapist gives you a strong
      massage. A deep tissue massage shouldn’t cause horrible pain—and if it does you need to tell
      your therapist you need less pressure. However, if they’ve been working your muscles, you will
      probably feel it as the toxins leave your body. Another side effect is a feeling of
      disorientation when the massage is over (we call it massage drunk). You may be a little light
      headed and out of it. That’s very normal. Just sit in the lobby and drink some water until the
      feeling passes! You’ll usually be fine in 10 to 15 minutes. Finally, a deep tissue massage
      will leave you dehydrated. That’s why your therapist gives you water when it’s over. It is
      very important to drink plenty of water after a therapeutic massage. Where to Get Deep Tissue

      BENEFITS OF GOLF MASSAGE Prevents Injuries. In golf, as with any other sport, there’s always a
      chance for injury. Fortunately, massage is a great way to lower your risk. Regular sessions
      can help reduce spasms and scar tissue and relieve trigger points. When your muscles are
      relaxed, they are less likely to suffer strains or tears while playing. In addition, your
      Tampa Bay Sports Massage therapist will also be able to detect small adhesions and work them
      out before becoming a serious issue. Improves Posture When it comes to golf, good posture is
      critical for better performance. Golf and fitness massage therapy can reduce the muscle
      tightness that causes postural imbalances, helping the body assume correct position. Improved
      posture will not only improve your golf swing but also reduce the risk of elbow injuries –like
      the dreaded golf elbow - and tendonitis. Increases Range of Motion & Flexibility. Golfers
      often experience tightness in the forearms, shoulders, lower back, and hips due to overuse of
      playing. Golf massage is effective at loosening and stretching stiff joints and muscles, thus
      creating a more fluid motion in the golf swing. Regular massage, combined with daily
      stretching, will improve your range of motion and flexibility as well as increase your power
      and performance. GOLF MASSAGE CONCENTRATES ON RELAXING THE BACK, HAMSTRINGS, HIP FLEXORS,
      SHOULDERS, AND WRISTS TO CREATE A BIGGER SHOULDER TURN, BETTER HIP AND BACK FLEXIBILITY, AND A
      MORE POWERFUL TORQUE AND HIGHER FINISH. Pain Relief. It should come as no surprise, but the
      force and repetitive movement used in a golf swing can result in muscle soreness and spasms –
      both of which can be extremely painful. Deep tissue massage therapy can help lengthen and
      relax the contracted muscle and provide much-needed relief to soreness. Improves Circulation.
      Another great benefit to golf massage is its ability to improve blood flow around the body.
      Good circulation helps prevent the buildup of toxins in the muscles, which left untreated, can
      cause muscle pain and stiffness. The rhythmic strokes and pressure used in massage releases
      the accumulation of toxins and helps oxygenated blood get to your sore muscles, allowing them
      to recover faster. Improves Mental Focus. In every sport, mental toughness always plays a
      role. When that key putt is on the line, too much stress, anxiety, and pressure can negatively
      affect your game and cause you to lose focus. Stress can also result in the involuntary
      clenching of muscles, which is counterproductive for golfers who need their swing to be as
      fluid as possible. Massage therapy is a great way to relax your mind, thus helping your
      muscles and improving your overall game. IS THERE A TIME I SHOULDN’T GET A GOLF MASSAGE? Great
      question! Our South Tampa massage therapists generally recommend you book your golf massage at
      least 48 hours prior to tee time. If you book an appointment too close to playing, you could
      be too sore to play, or your muscles won’t perform at their best. Close to tee time? Try a
      standing forward bend stretch. Golfers can try this stretch before hitting the links, putting
      green, or in between holes as needed. Here’s how to make the most of the stretch: Standing up
      straight (chin up!) feet together with your shoulders relaxed. Reach arms behind your back and
      interlock fingers. Lift your shoulders towards your ears and lift your hands away from the
      back. Slowly bend forward at the waist. Your back should be flat, not rounded. As far as your
      body allows, bend forward and lift your hands above your head as far forward as comfortable.
      Hold for 10-20 seconds and release. Repeat two to three times. When in a full standing forward
      bend stretch, you may feel slight tension in your hamstrings and/or in your shoulders. If the
      tension is too much, reduce the angle of your back. Don’t extend beyond your ability. With
      proper form, you can release tension in your back and shoulders so you can get back in
      alignment for your golf strokes. MASSAGE FOR GOLFERS As you can see, there are many benefits
      of golf massage. Feel the difference that golf and fitness massage at Tampa Bay Sports &
      Medical Massage can make for your game! To speak with a specialist, call us at +(351) 963 531

      your session too; Book your appointment for a golf sports massage today!

      PHYSICALLY SPEAKING: RECOVERY MASSAGE August 22, 2021 Recovery massage focuses on three key
      areas: Restoration of the whole body Prevention from injury through early identification and
      treatment of problem areas Preparation of the mind and body for competition or training
      Understanding why, how and when to have a recovery massage is an important aspect of your
      preparation and performance in tennis. WHY? Recovery Massage: Increases blood and lymph
      circulation helping muscles to recover Decreases muscle soreness and shortens recovery time by
      removing waste products Helps muscle endurance and power output when playing multiple matches
      • Reduces muscle fatigue Restores/improves flexibility Helps calm the nervous system and
      relaxes the body Helps prevent injuries HOW? "Flushing" is not a massage method. It is the
      result of the combination of techniques Recovery massage may include the following techniques:
      Longitudinal strokes: Method: Initially, the stroke is applied slowly and with light pressure.
      It is a long flowing, broad stroke to warm the soft tissues and help with relaxation. The
      stroke provides sensory feedback to the therapist about areas of soft tissue tightness or
      restrictions that may require treatment to reduce the risk of injury. The stroke is then
      applied gradually to deeper levels. Results: 1. Helps to realign muscle fibres for stretch and
      allows them to contract and relax without restriction. 2. Reduces inflammation and supports
      muscle regeneration. 3. Blood flow and lymphatic drainage can be improved. Kneading: Method: A
      rhythmical lifting, rolling and squeezing technique of tissues. Results: Encourages a
      reflexive relaxation of the muscles and connective tissue softening. Compressions: Method:
      This technique can be applied broadly across a muscle or group of muscles. Results: Encourages
      blood circulation, connective tissue softening and muscle relaxation when applied at a
      superficial level. Longitudinal strokes should follow compression strokes to further encourage
      tissue alignment and blood flow. Broad Cross Fibre Friction: Method: Applied across a muscle
      or group of muscles, the aim is to separate the muscle and fascial (tissue) adhesions that may
      have restricted blood flow. Results: Improves nutrient supply to the muscles which helps speed
      post exercise muscle repair. Vibration or Shaking: Method: Gentle shaking to assess the soft
      tissues mobility. Results: Further relaxes the soft tissues and allows them to move more
      easily. Light Stretching: Method: Lengthening and elongating the muscle fibres in a controlled
      way, using a variety of methods. Results: Relaxes the muscles and improves flexibility. Ice
      Massage: Method: Rubbing an ice bag or ‘ice in a cup’ over the skin. Results: When the cold is
      removed, blood, which is full of nutrients, floods back into the area and re-oxygenates the
      tissues. Cools soft tissues, minimises inflammation and promotes healing. Other techniques may
      be applied depending on what you and the massage therapist discover about the condition of
      your body in the recovery massage session. WHEN? When receiving a recovery massage remember
      the following: Schedule the massage 1-3 hours after your match or training (practice/fitness).
      Ideally, recovery massage is most effective 30-60 minutes post-match, or post training, but no
      longer than 24 hours later. A recovery massage can be completed within 15-30 minutes,
      depending on the area. If specific areas require treatment, this can be carried out
      immediately after the recovery massage or at a later time and preferably no later than the
      next day. Recovery massage is not deep tissue. Lighter long flowing strokes are used to align
      soft tissue fibres, promote blood flow and lymph drainage, quiet the nervous system and slow
      the breathing, relaxing the whole body. 4. Be actively involved in your massage sessions.
      Recovery massage is an ‘awareness’ time for you. Use this time to ‘tune in’ to your body and
      provide feedback to the massage therapist. Understand what your body is telling you. How have
      you coped physically, mentally and emotionally with the challenges of competition and life on
      the road? Developing self-awareness may help you to understand your specific and individual
      requirements and your state of readiness to perform. Turn off your phone! Have some proper
      ‘time out’ and be fully engaged with the therapy process. Psychological benefits, including
      greater calmness, can result in insight and focus when you allow yourself to pay attention to
      your body and the massage. This will help your tennis performance. Always use a qualified and
      experienced sports massage therapist. They have your goal in mind. Correct application will
      assist your recovery and prepare you for the next match. The WTA offers certified massage
      therapists at each event. Massage therapy treatment works best in conjunction with adequate
      hydration, a tennis specific nutritional regime, regular stretching, psychological relaxation
      and mindfulness methods and a minimum of 7-9 hours’ sleep each night. Together these assist
      the restorative processes for the tennis player. When properly rested, the body can perform
      optimally during training and competition. To speak with a specialist, call us at +(351) 963
      531 684. We’re happy to answer your MASSAGE QUESTIONS. Of course, questions are welcome during
      your session too; Book your appointment today!
